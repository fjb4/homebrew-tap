John's Homebrew Tap
===
This is the repository for [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) packages that I use but I couldn't find an existing tap.

To install a package:

```
brew tap fjb4/tap
brew install <pks-cli>
```

Available packages:

| Package     | Description                                                |
|:------------|:-----------------------------------------------------------|
| pks-cli     | The official PKS CLI                                       |
